    detail: "“This was the LORD’s doing; It is marvelous in our eyes” (Psalms 118: 23). It indeed gives me great joy in sharing the marvelous experiences I had in Karunya which has sculptured me to who I am today. I am a person from biology background who had no idea of joining Engineering. But I thank god for He chose me to be “One in a million” which I realized the very first day I joined Karuya. It was all because of the grace of God and motivation of my department staffs, a person like me who hated Engineering was able to pass out with honors. Our department is enriched with lots of facilities to explore beyond books. It was through one of the workshops offered by our department I got an opportunity to do my final year project with a professor from Israel University (Technion- Israel Institute of Technology) who is also in collaboration with Karunya University. This Project helped me explore more in the field of Power Systems and Switchgears. During my final year I got placed in “Swifterz Creative solution” Where they offered training on a Software during my course of study. The knowledge which was inculcated through this project and Software was the sole reason for my recruitment in one of the top MNCs’ Hitachi-ABB Power Grids. I truly can’t find words to thank the friendly and supportive staffs who is much concerned about the holistic development of their students. Karunya is a place which not only raises a skilled professional but also a purposeful person and a humanitarian. My period of stay in Karunya was the time I was able to know the purpose of my life. Hostel Prayers cells and Division fellowship helped me to grow in God and instilled a zeal to work and Shine for Him in every walks of my Life. I would like to encourage my juniors to grab the opportunities which lies ahead and give your best. You are in the hands of a perfect potter who is molding you into a prefect, useful vessel."

    name: "Mr.ANURAG NANTOWAR",
    detail: "My name is Anurag Nantowar. I have graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Division in Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences in the year 2018 (Batch of 2014-2018). Firstly, I would like to thank God for being with me throughout my whole journey of 4 years and for helping me to become department topper with a CGPA of 9.16 . I would also like to thank all my faculty members for being with us always, in all ups and downs; and also helping us to grow spiritually. The senior-junior relationship which we experience in Karunya is also very healthy and it even helps me till date. With the help of my department and the placement cell of Karunya, I have got 2 placements, one in KPIT (it’s a core company related to the field of automotive engineering) and second one in Infosys (it’s a software service provider company). The Placement coaching session provided by the University was also helpful for me to clear the aptitude round during campus placement. For clearing the technical round, my department had provided special refresher sessions to brush-up old concepts. Currently, I am working in KPIT, Bangalore. The climate and environment we have in Karunya is very beautiful. It is perfect for acquiring knowledge as well as growing spiritually."

Studying in this institute has been a great time, with its immense beauty, it also has India’s best teaching faculty and labs which has helped me gain knowledge and train me well as an electrical engineer. The Institution always helps me in every possible ways to achieve my dream. Here the potential is harnessed, skills are developed, and dreams are realized. The days spend in karunya was the golden days of my life and I will remember it for rest of my life."
